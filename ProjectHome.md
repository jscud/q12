I found myself needing a few common utilities as I was writing an Ajax application. Rather than use a heavyweight or verbose library, I wanted something compact that minimized the amount of typing I needed to do. This is where the name q12 comes from, just three little keys up there in the upper left corner of the keyboard.

This library provides functions for the following:
  * Basic DOM manipulation
  * Asynchronous HTTP requests with callbacks
  * Class methods and inheritance
  * Base64 encoding and other forms of data escaping
  * AES encryption
  * ARC4 encryption
  * Cookie manipulation
